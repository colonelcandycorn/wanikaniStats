# Wanikani Stats

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to use Rust to obtain useful
information from Wanikani's API about a specific user (currently unsure
if this will be hardcoded as my API key in the backend
or have the user supply their API key in a form). 

The primary information I want to provide is the information
that is not available at all or available easily on the main Wanikani site like
percentage of times you get your answers wrong or how many Kanji/vocab you know
above a certain level.

This information will be presented as an HTML page or it will work as a console
application displaying the information to the terminal.
